# MatlabForNeuroscientists-Notes-and-Excersises-
This repository contains my scratch-work and notes from working through the Matlab For Neuroscientists textbook written by Mike X Cohen. I pick up from Chapter 10, as chapters 1-10 are largely MATLAB basics tutorials (and I didnt save my scripts of reviewing these chapters :) ) 

% all code written by Suhaas Adiraju, and notes elaborated on from MatlabForNeuroscientists by Mike X Cohen
